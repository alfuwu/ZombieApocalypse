This mod adds zombie apocalypse mechanics to Terraria. You may choose whether or not players are only turned when killed by a zombie, or turn if they're killed by anything.

By default, a player will become a zombie if they're killed by anything.

As a zombie, you may only use the items in the first four slots of your hotbar, along with the first three accesory slots, armor slots, and misc slots. You are not able to use the ammo/coin slots either. You will, by default, drop all of the items your are unable to use upon death, however you can disable this behavior in the config.
You can also damage players, regardless of PvP status.

This mod also ramps up zombie spawns :)

Recommended to play with friends on a Master mode (hardcore?) world.

The original request by Throarbin:
[quote=Thoarbin]If you die you turn into a zombie and then you can attack other players so it's meant to be played with a lot of people. A lot more zombies spawn and maybe even some custom zombies that upgrade as time goes on or something. If you die you become one of the zombies, losing most of your inventory, equipment, ect, but you can kill players even with pvp off. I think this could be an AWESOME multiplayer mod[/quote]
