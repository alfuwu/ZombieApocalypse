This mod adds zombie apocalypse mechanics to Terraria.

By default, a player will become a zombie if they're killed by anything, however you can change this in the config to make it so that players will only turn into a zombie if they are killed by another zombie.

As a zombie, you may only use the items in the first five slots of your hotbar, along with the first two accessory slots (three if on master mode, and four if on expert or higher after consuming a Demon Heart), all armor slots, and all misc slots. You are not able to use the ammo/coin slots either, unless enabled in the config.
You will, by default, drop all of the items your are unable to use upon zombification, however you can disable this behavior in the config.
You can also damage players, regardless of PvP status.

This mod also ramps up zombie spawns :)

Recommended to play with friends on a Master mode (hardcore?) world.

Most of this mod is configurable, so take a look at the config if you want to adjust the mod, because you most likely can! :)

Additionally, this mod adds a few new types of zombies to the game:
* Bucket Zombie - just a zombie with a bucket on its head :)
* Commando Zombie - a hardmode zombie with a M4A1 Carbine rifle.
* Zorm - a zombie worm that spawns in the underground and cavern layers.
* Giant Zorm - a hardmode equivalent of the zorm.
* Zombified Mummy - a mummy variant that only spawns in deserts at night.
* Zombunny - a cute little bunny but its a zombie. Spawns in the forest biome during the day.
* Zombie Bat - a zombified cave bat. Spawns in the cavern layer.
* Zombie Eye - a zombified demon eye. Spawns on the surface or the sky during the night.
* Zombie Slime - a zombified slime. Spawns in the forest biome at any time of day.

The original request by Throarbin:
[quote=Thoarbin]If you die you turn into a zombie and then you can attack other players so it's meant to be played with a lot of people. A lot more zombies spawn and maybe even some custom zombies that upgrade as time goes on or something. If you die you become one of the zombies, losing most of your inventory, equipment, ect, but you can kill players even with pvp off. I think this could be an AWESOME multiplayer mod[/quote]
